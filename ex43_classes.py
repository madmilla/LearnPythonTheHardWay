"""
â€œAliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has to go through a maze of
rooms defeating them so he can escape into an escape pod to the planet
below. The game will be more like a Zork or Adventure type game with text
outputs and funny ways to die. The game will involve an engine that runs a
map full of rooms or scenes. Each room will print its own description when
the player enters it and then tell the engine what room to run next out of the
map."""
